 A young engineer with a growing passion for computer engineering, specifically embedded systems, computer
                    science, and software development. Graduating in December of 2020 from UCF I am looking forward to starting
                    my career as a Software Engineer. My passion for programming grows as I learn new technologies and create 
                    more software that can do amazing things.
